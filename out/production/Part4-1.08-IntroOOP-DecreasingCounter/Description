Objective
---------
Part 1:
Implement the decrement() method in the class body in such a way that it decrements the value variable of the object it's being called on by one.
Once you're done with the decrement() method, the main program of the previous example should work to produce the example output.

Part 2:
Implement the decrement() in such a way that the counter's value never becomes negative.
This means that if the value of the counter is 0, it cannot be decremented.
A conditional statement is useful here.

Part 3:
Create the method public void reset() for the counter that resets the value of the counter to 0.


Template to use
---------------
public class DecreasingCounter {
    private int value;   // a variable that remembers the value of the counter

    public DecreasingCounter(int initialValue) {
        this.value = initialValue;
    }

    public void printValue {
        System.out.println("value: " + this.value);
    }

    public void decrement() {
        // write the method implementation here
        // the aim is to decrement the value of the counter by one
    }

    // and the other methods go here
}
