Objective
---------
The exercise template has a class Product, which represents a product in a shop. Every product has a name, location and weight.

Add the following three constructors to the Product class:

    public Product(String name) creates a product with the given name. Its location is set to "shelf" and its weight is set to 1.

    public Product(String name, String location) creates a product with the given name and the given location. Its weight is set to 1.

    public Product(String name, int weight) creates a product with the given name and the given weight. Its location is set to "shelf".

You can test your program with the following code:
Product tapeMeasure = new Product("Tape measure");
Product plaster = new Product("Plaster", "home improvement section");
Product tyre = new Product("Tyre", 5);

System.out.println(tapeMeasure);
System.out.println(plaster);
System.out.println(tyre);

Output:
Tape measure (1 kg) can be found from the shelf
Plaster (1 kg) can be found from the home improvement section
Tyre (5 kg) can be found from the shelf
