Objective
---------
Write a program that asks the user for a string, and then prints the contents of a file with a name matching the string provided.
You may assume that the user provides a file name that the program can find.

The exercise template contains the files "data.txt" and "song.txt", which you may use when testing the functionality of your program.
The output of the program can be seen below for when a user has entered the string "song.txt".
The content that is printed comes from the file "song.txt". Naturally, the program should also work with other filenames, assuming the file can be found.
