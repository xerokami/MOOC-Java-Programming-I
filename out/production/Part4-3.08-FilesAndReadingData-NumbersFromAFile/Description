Objective
---------
Write a program that prompts the user for a filename, as well as the upper and lower bounds for the accepted range of numbers. Then the program reads the numbers contained in the file (each number is on its own line) and only accounts for the numbers which are inside the given range. Finally, the program should print the number of numbers that were inside the given range.

You can convert a string-type integer read from a file into a proper integer using the command Integer.valueOf (just as when handling input from a user).
