Objective
---------
In this exercise you get to implement a program that can be used to handle an archive. Several items can be added to it. When no more items are added, all the items in the archive are printed.

Part1:
The program should read items from the user. When all the items from the user have been read, the program prints the information of each item.

For each item, its identifier and name should be read. If the identifier or name is empty, the program stops asking for input, and prints all the item information.

Example print:
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07H8ND8HH
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man figure
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07H8ND8HH
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07NQFMZYG
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man figure
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07NQFMZYG
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man figure
Identifier? (empty will stop)

==Items==
B07H8ND8HH: He-Man figure
B07H8ND8HH: He-Man
B07NQFMZYG: He-Man figure
B07NQFMZYG: He-Man figure

Part2:
Modify the program so that after entering the items, each item is printed at most once. Two items should be considered the same if their identifiers are the same (there can be variation in their names in different countries, for instance).

If the user enters the same item multiple times, the print uses the item that was added first.

Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07H8ND8HH
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man figure
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07H8ND8HH
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07NQFMZYG
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man figure
Identifier? (empty will stop)
B07NQFMZYG
Name? (empty will stop)
He-Man figure
Identifier? (empty will stop)

==Items==
B07H8ND8HH: He-Man figure
B07NQFMZYG: He-Man figure
