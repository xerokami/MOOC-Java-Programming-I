Objective
---------
Create a Cube class that represents a cube (i.e., a standard hexahedron). Create a public Cube (int edgeLength) constructor for the class, that takes the length of the cube's edge as its parameter.

Make a public int volume() method for the cube, which calculates and returns the cube's volume. The volume of the cube is calculated with the formula edgeLength * edgeLength * edgeLength. Moreover, make a public String toString() method for the cube, which returns a string representation of it. The string representation should take the form "The length of the edge is l and the volume v", where l is the length and v the volume - both the length and volume must be represented as integers.

Examples are provided underneath

Cube oSheaJackson = new Cube(4);
System.out.println(oSheaJackson.volume());
System.out.println(oSheaJackson);

System.out.println();

Cube salt = new Cube(2);
System.out.println(salt.volume());
System.out.println(salt);

Output:
64
The length of the edge is 4 and the volume 64

8
The length of the edge is 2 and the volume 8
