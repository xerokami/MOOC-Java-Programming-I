Part1 Smallest value:
Create in the class MainProgram a class method smallest that takes an integer array as a parameter. It should return the smallest value in the array.

Here is the structure of the method:

public static int smallest(int[] array){
    // write your code here
}

Example:
int[] numbers = {6, 5, 8, 7, 11};
System.out.println("Smallest: " + MainProgram.smallest(numbers));

Smallest: 5


Part2 Index of smallest value:
Create a method called indexOfSmallest in the class MainProgram. It should return the index of the smallest number in the array that it receives as a parameter.

Here is the structure of the method:

public static int indexOfSmallest(int[] array){
    // write your code here
}

Example:
// indices:      0  1  2  3  4
int[] numbers = {6, 5, 8, 7, 11};
System.out.println("Index of the smallest number: " + MainProgram.indexOfSmallest(numbers));

Index of the smallest number: 1


Part3 Index of smallest value after certain value:
Create in the class MainProgram a class method called indexOfSmallestFrom. It works similarly to the method in the previous section, but only considers the table values from a certain index forwards. In addition to the table, it receives this start index as a parameter.

The structure of the method is the following:

public static int indexOfSmallestFrom(int[] table, int startIndex) {
    // write your code here
}

Example:
// indices:       0  1  2  3   4
int[] numbers = {-1, 6, 9, 8, 12};
System.out.println(MainProgram.indexOfSmallestFrom(numbers, 0));
System.out.println(MainProgram.indexOfSmallestFrom(numbers, 1));
System.out.println(MainProgram.indexOfSmallestFrom(numbers, 2));

In this example the first method call searches for the index of the smallest number, starting from index 0. Starting from index 0, the smallest number is -1 and its index is 0. The second method call searches for the index of the smallest value starting from index 1. In this case the smallest number is 6 and its index is 1. The third calls searches for the index of the smallest value starting at index 2. Then the smallest number is 8 and its index is 3.


Part4 Swapping numbers:
Create a class method swap in the class MainProgram. It receives as its parameters an array and two indices inside it. The method swaps the numbers in these indices with each other.

The basic structure of the method is:

public static void swap(int[] array, int index1, int index2) {
    // write your code here
}

The following illustrates how to use the method. To print an array we take use of the toString class method of the class Arrays. It formats an array into an easily readable string.

int[] numbers = {3, 2, 5, 4, 8};

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));

MainProgram.swap(numbers, 1, 0);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));

MainProgram.swap(numbers, 0, 3);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));


Part5 Sorting:
We have now assembled a set of useful methods. With their help, we can implement a sorting algorithm known by the name of selection sort.

The idea of selection sort is:

    Move the smallest number in the array to index 0.

    Move the second smallest number to index 1.

    Move the third smalles number in the array to index 2.

    Etc.

In other words:

    Examine the array starting from index 0. Swap the following two numbers with each other: the number at index 0, and the smallest number in the array starting from index 0.
    Examine the array starting from index 1. Swap the following two numbers with each other: the number at index 1, and the smallest number in the array starting from index 1.
    Examine the array starting from index 2. Swap the following two numbers with each other: the number at index 2, and the smallest number in the array starting from index 2.
    Etc.

Implement a class method called sort based on the idea above in the class MainProgram. It should include a loop that goes through the indices of the array. Certainly the method indexOfSmallestFrom and swap will come in handy. Additionally, print the contents of the array before sorting and after every iteration of the loop to ensure that the algorithm works as you expect it to.

The definition of the method looks like this:

public static void sort(int[] array) {

}

Example:
int[] numbers = {8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4};
MainProgram.sort(numbers);

Output:
[8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4]
[1, 3, 7, 9, 8, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 7, 9, 8, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]


Mark how the array becomes sorted little by little starting from the beginning and advancing towards the end of the array.
