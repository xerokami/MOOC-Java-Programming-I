Objective
---------

In this exercise you will design and implement a database for bird-watchers. The database contains birds, each of which has a name (string) and a name in Latin (string). The database also counts the observations of each bird.

The program must implement the following commands:

    Add - adds a bird

    Observation - adds an observation

    All - prints all birds

    One - prints one bird

    Quit - ends the program

Incorrect input must also be handled. The following is an example of the program functionality:

? Add
Name: Crow
Name in Latin: Corvus Corvus
? Add
Name: Hawk
Name in Latin: Dorkus Dorkus
? Observation
Bird? Hawk
? Observation
Bird? Lion
Not a bird!
? Observation
Bird? Hawk
? All
Hawk (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
Crow (Corvus Corvus): 0 observations
? One
Bird? Hawk
Hawk (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
? Quit

NB You're free to structure your program the way you want.
We only test that the main method of the mainProgram class works as shown above.
You will most likely find it useful to use classes that are descriptive of the problem domain.
