Objective
---------
The exercise template already has a Person class, and the class StoringRecords has a body for the method public static ArrayList<Person> readRecordsFromFile(String file). Implement the readRecordsFromFile method such that it reads the persons from the file passed as a parameter, and finally returns them in the list returned by the method.

The exercise template has a main method that you can use to test how your program works. In this exercise, only modify the method readRecordsFromFile.
