Objective
---------
In this exercise, we'll be working with files stored in CSV-format that contain names and ages separated by commas.

Format output:
lily,3
anton,5
levi,4
amy,1

Your task is to write a program that first prompts the user for the name of the file they want to read. The program then prints the content of the file in the following way (we're assuming below that the output is from the above-mentioned file):

Sample output:
Name of the file:
data.txt
lily, age: 3 years
anton, age: 5 years
levi, age: 4 years
amy, age: 1 year
