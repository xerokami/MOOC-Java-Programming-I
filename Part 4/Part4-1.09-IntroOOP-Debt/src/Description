}

Objective
---------
Create the class Debt that has double-typed instance variables of balance and interestRate.
The balance and the interest rate are passed to the constructor as parameters public Debt(double initialBalance, double initialInterestRate).

In addition, create the methods public void printBalance() and public void waitOneYear() for the class.
The method printBalance prints the current balance, and the waitOneYear method grows the debt amount.

The debt is increased by multiplying the balance by the interest rate.
